How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   Using git log, I can display all the commits (changes) that have ever 
   happened to the tracked files. Then, using git diff, I can display all the
   differences between two different commits of my choosing.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?
   
   If I did break something, I can just immediately revert back to the previous
   working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
   
   I now feel comfortable enough to use Git for any variety of projects I want
   to do, and I can do most of my programming from the terminal.
