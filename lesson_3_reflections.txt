When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I am collaborating with other people on a project, or I want my work on a 
  project to be accessible by other people, then it would very beneficial to 
  have my work online. This enables easy accessibility and teamwork, and is much 
  easier than copying and sending individual files through email or whatever 
  you'd use otherwise.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Other people may have pushed changes to the remote, while you may be working
   on things unrelated to those, or doing the same things in different ways, and
   it would definitely not be a good idea for other people's changes to be 
   automatically be pulled to your local repo. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

   Forking is GitHub specific: if you see someone else's repository on Github
   that you would like to also work on (without contributing to that person's
   project), you can fork that repository to your own GitHub and then you will
   have a clone of their repository on your GitHub account.

   You can then clone that repo to your machine locally. Cloning is for copying
   other repos from one location to another. If you feel like moving your repo
   for a certain file locally from one folder to another, you can clone it. You
   can also clone remotes onto your local machine if you want to make changes to
   it locally, and then push to the remote later.

   Branches are done locally, but the repository records branches and thus
   branches created locally can also be pushed to a remote, and then the remote
   also has data on any new branches. Then, when people pull or clone the
   remote, the creation of those branches will also be in the repository.
